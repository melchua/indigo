![Player Demo](public/screenshots/dhplayer-demo-new.gif?raw=true "Demo")

Responsive custom video player that allows for mirroring, multi-angle, and speed controls. This works in full screen for desktop and inline video for mobile / responsive. This player is currently setup to toggle between two camera angle feeds. They will seamlessly transition between each other because you will essentially be only playing one video: the videos will have to be stitched to each other (top to bottom) and must be the exact same dimensions.
