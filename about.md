<h1>Shorter Story</h1>

While we shouldn't be defined by our jobs, since this is my portfolio site, I will focus these descriptions primarily on my career path. I have eight years of experience working in various roles in the tech industry. I'm currently working as a full-stack web developer at a company that builds prototypes for celebrities and the film industry. On the side, I am a partner in a start-up that is creating an online on-demand video platform for dance education and instruction - we are launching MVP on March 2019.

<h1>Longer Story</h1>
<p>Ever since my mom brought home my first computer, an 80286 Intel, Iâ€™ve wanted to code; granted it was primarily to hack Nibbles in Qbasic so I could finally win the game - Life question: Does Nibbles ever end? I was the kid that hosted lan parties to play Warcraft 2 (before there was a World of Warcraft) and Duke Nukem 3D - it goes to say my social skills developed at a later age.</p>

<p>As life would have it, I ended up moving away from tech, completed a political science degree, began the route to law school to try to change the world. After my first summer job at a law firm, I decided that law wasn't anything like Ally McBeal had led me to believe. I lived in Thailand for a year teaching English, ran out of money, then went back to school and got a degree in business administration with a concentration in finance and became a bartender to develop all those social skills that were missing from my early childhood years.

<p>When I started to feel the brain rot from the 2 years of bartending set in, I decided to jumpstart my brain and get into the tech world, and ended up working as a customer service / data migration specialist in the growing Vancouver Fintech sector. After leaving Global Relay, I moved back to my hometown of Kelowna to spend the next two years writing SQL queries for ETL tools as a data analyst in at an EMR company in the medical technology services field.

<p>Seeking a bigger challenge, I decide to make a move into the E-commerce industry by becoming a Project Manager for the top Drupal E-commerce company in North America. Small company, but great culture. I got to work with
